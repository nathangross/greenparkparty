# RSVP Form Behavior

The RSVP form is implemented as a Livewire Volt component with the following key behaviors:

## Required Fields
- `first_name` - Always required
- `email` - Required if `receive_email_updates` is true
- `phone` - Required if `receive_sms_updates` is true
- `attending_count` - Required and must be positive when `showAttending` is true

## Optional Fields
- `last_name`
- `street`
- `message`
- `volunteer` (boolean)

## Message Handling
When users update their RSVP with new messages, they are appended with prefixes:
- First message: "New message: {message}"
- Subsequent messages: "Message update: {message}"

## Validation Rules
1. Email must be valid format when provided
2. Phone number must be valid format when provided
3. Attending count must be non-negative
4. RSVPs are only accepted when there is an active party

## Update Behavior
- Users are identified by email address for updates
- Multiple submissions update the existing RSVP
- All message history is preserved
- Contact information (name, phone, email) is updated
- Attendance count can be modified
