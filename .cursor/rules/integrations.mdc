# External Integrations

The application integrates with external services for communication:

## Mailchimp Integration
- Users who opt-in for email updates are added to Mailchimp
- Integration is fault-tolerant - RSVP submission succeeds even if Mailchimp fails
- Configuration is managed through the Laravel Newsletter package
- Users are only added when they provide an email address

## SMS Updates
- Users can opt-in for SMS updates
- Phone number validation is enforced when SMS updates are requested
- SMS integration is prepared but actual implementation may vary

## Newsletter Configuration
The newsletter configuration is managed through Laravel's config system:
- API key configuration in environment variables
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid configuration
- Mailchimp list management through the Newsletter facade

## Error Handling
- Failed Mailchimp operations don't block RSVP submission
- Invalid configurations are handled gracefully
- Missing API keys or configuration issues are logged but don't affect core functionality
